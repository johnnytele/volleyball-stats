# volleyball-stats
This is an incomplete app built on React Native that was supposed to be an iPad app that would be used to track the stats of the players on a volleyball team

This app used Redux, SQLite, and developed with Expo. I used this project as a way to learn React and reactivity. It ended up uncompleted because I realized that in a game, players need a coach who will give them in game advice rather than stats. Everything is built up until the part where the stats are actually taken and are displayed.
